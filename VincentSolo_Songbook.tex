\begin{song}{Spring}

\begin{couplet}
A splitted path yet we will always belong
Never the past will return
From so long ago
\end{couplet}

\begin{refrain}
I don't know where the future lies
I don't know if we could have suffered through all of our lies
I don't know if we could have been better off again
But now i'm not afraid of the spring
\end{refrain}

\begin{couplet}
So the decision's been made
I did not know i was so ready to reach the end
\end{couplet}

\begin{refrain}
I don't know if the future will bite
I don't know if we can befriend and keep on holding tight
I don't know if we could have been better off again
But now i'm looking forward to the spring
\end{refrain}

\begin{couplet}
I'll never fully understand what drove us apart
As you didn't even know
Now i'm Moving on embracing the life I will make up for myself
\end{couplet}

\begin{refrain}
I don't know if we could have been better off again
I don't know if we can befriend and win in the end
Now i feel free to go wherever i feel i belong
I hope the spring will last for long
I hope the spring will last for long
I hope the spring will last
\end{refrain}

\end{song}
